## KubeConfig Context Switch
Simple cli tool for kube config context switching with filtering capabilities. It loads `~/.kube/config` yaml, and if selection is made, edits it. Nothing too fancy. It doesent make backups at the moment, so if your object is not included in `kubeConfig` type it might get lost, will add backups later âš¡
